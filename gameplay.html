					<h3>Gameplay</h3>
					<h4><u>Overview</u></h4>
					<p>The game is based around saving a cliff that is under attack from natural elements such as wind and the sea. There is a storm coming and the characters, which are the wind and water are attacking the cliff face and are slowly trying to knock the ancient, priceless trophy off of the edge of the cliff and into the abyss sea below, to never to be seen again. However, players can slow down this process and maybe perhaps even prevent this from happening just by erecting towers. Towers are in the form of wind defenders and wave defenders and such alike. You can implement things such as hydropower to generate electricity, the profit that is made to the electricity will then be added to your points balance and you can purchase repairs for the cliff face to try and prevent any further damage and so on and so forth. If the player doesn&apos;t not succeed in their aims to protect the trophy, the cliff will collapse and the trophy will never be seen again and lost forever, and never to be seen again, this marks the end of the game for the user and then the game will give the user an option to submit their score, play again or to quit the game.</p>
					<h4>Turrets</h4>
					<h5>Wave-breakers</h5>
					<p>Wave-breakers are defence towers that can only be places within the sea part of the map layout. They are designed to rest on the bottom of the seabed and there main purpose is to stop all waves that approach. As the levels gradually increase in hardness and speeds as the player progresses throughout the game, the affects of these wave breakers will eventually get weaker as the waves will get stronger, the way to mainly over come this would be to implement more wave-breakers and so on and so forth.</p>
					<h5>Wind-breakers</h5>
					<p>Wind-breakers are defence towers that are designed to go parallel or close to the cliff face. The wind-breaker is essentially a sheet or solid material such as plastic/metal which deflects the wind from being able to hit the cliff face. As said previously, as the levels gradually increase with the player&apos;s progress throughout the game, the wind will get stronger and thus the wind-breaker&apos;s will get weaker and the way to also overcome this is by implementing more wind-breakers into the map.</p>
					<h4>Enemies</h4>
					<h5>Sea</h5>
					<p>The sea is displayed as a water drop with very basic facial features to give it characteristics. The sea has the ability to slowly ware down the cliff face and make indentations. The sea can be prevented from attack by such things as wave breakers, which break the waves completely, slow the down or just make them smaller which is all depending on the player&apos;s stage/level in the game at the time, as characters get stronger as you progress through the game, when you earn more points and when you place new items.<br><img src="sea.png" alt="sea" height="100" width="100"></p>
					<h5>Wind</h5>
					<p>The wind is represented by a mini tornado whirlpool. Wind causes the cliff face to dry and crack up and become more brittle, especially so after the sea has just hit into it, as it&apos;s more moist and prone to breaking up. In later levels the wind can make the sea more choppy when it approaches the cliff face which then in return makes more sea characters appear and attempt to attack the cliff face, which then the player needs to try and defend against using towers and any power-ups that they may have at that particular time in the game.<br><img src="wind.png" alt="wind" height="100" width="100"></p>
                  <h4>Unique Feature</h4>
					<p>This game is fairly unique, as it&apos;s moral is pretty subliminal, but relative. The approach to this allows the player to enjoy the game without having obvious learning material shoved in front of their faces while playing a game. The message is already within the game that they&apos;re playing and hopefully they will be able to see this over time. Other games like it such Bloon Tower Defense do not have any morals to them, such as protecting nature etc, they seem to have little aim to when when they have the potential to do so much more.</p>
