					<h3>Story</h3>
                    <h4><u>Game Story</u></h4>
					<p>There once was a ancient tribe,the local tribes attacked the wealthy tribe and night where they couldn&apos;t be spotted that easily as they were all asleep in their homes. The local tribes slowly snuck up to the wealthy tribe&apos;s village and started to load their bags full of all the valuables that they could get their hands on without alerting or waking up any of the wealthy tribe&apos;s people. They managed to do this successfully and to great effect.
The following morning the wealthy tribe awoke from their sleep and notices that most of the valuables were missing and this caused alarm and confusion within the tribe&apos;s village.</p>
<p>The was-wealthy tribe then found out about the sneak attack set up on them by the other local tribes and they begged for forgiveness and asked for their items back, but to no effect, the local tribes were not going to bend and give in to their request, not after what had happened in the past. A few hundred years later these tribes and villages were flooded by a great flood and storm. All of their belongings were lost a part from 1 golden trophy. The golden trophy now rests on top of a cliff overlooking the sea that once took almost everything belonging to those tribes and villages.
Although, this trophy is now at risk of the cliff eroding now and it is up to the player to now protect this trophy from it dropping into the sea, never to be seen again. It is hugely important to maintain this trophy and protect it because of it&apos;s value, but more importantly because of it&apos;s historic value and what it represents, as it&apos;s the last remaining object to do with those tribes and villages. It&apos;s essentially a monument.
It is now the player&apos;s responsibility to save and protect that trophy.</p>
